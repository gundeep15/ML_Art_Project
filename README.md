Machine Learning to Match Paintings totheir Artists Using Variation in Brushstroke Styles

In this work, we propose a deep CNN-based algorithm that is capable of distinguishing between 4 similar paintings and identifying the corresponding artist who painted them. Our data consist of small tiles extracted from the paintings and magnitudes of vertical brushstroke heights at every 2D transverse location on the tiles. We hypothesize that a variation in the style and pattern of brushstroke can be used to ‘teach’ an AI algorithm to distinguish between our 4 artists.

By implementing deep learning and transfer learning, we also plan to heuristically study the physical basis of machine learning optimization for our data, specifically how different patch sizes and different pretrained models of different image datasets affect the learning of AI systems. The system we will develop as part of this project will not only have potential applications in the investigation of art forgery cases, but can also be extended to be used in building a style-based image retrieval system, differentiating art movement period, and even in building systems that regenerate learned forms of art.
